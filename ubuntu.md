#  Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) 
a new Windows 10 feature that enables you to **run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows**, alongside your traditional Windows desktop

Ubuntu is one of Linux distribution easily available on WSL.

[install ubuntu in wsl](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL?&_ga=2.232980126.1893481185.1618394455-755482584.1618394455#Running_Graphical_Applications)

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal) is the current LTS release, supporting both x64 and ARM64 architecture



# How to open ubuntu terminal ?

+ either search in search bar 
+ or type anyone of following  cmd in cmd prompt
```bash
wsl        # good way , opens bash in he current directory
wsl.exe
ubuntu     # open's bash in ~ i.e. /home/USERNAME directory
```
+ *or go to directory where u want to open ubuntu >> then type **`wsl`** in search bar of that dir >> click enter* **EFFICIENT WAY**


config settings of ubuntu(in cmd prompt)
===
```bash
ubuntu /

wsl --list --all       # view distribution of linux install in ur windows
wsl -l -v 
```

```bash
man <anyCmdKeyword>  # to know about what a cmd does

# e.g.

man ls
man ps
```


close terminal 
---
```bash
logout
```

1st open ubuntu terminal using [this](#how-to-open-ubuntu-terminal-)
![](pics/navigateToWindowsDirInWSL.jpg)


‚≠ê case sensitivity : bash cmds are supported in ***lowerCase*** usually


LINUX CONFIGURATIONS
```bash
lsb_release -a   # shows the ubuntu version installed
ps -el           # to see currently active process
ps               #

whoami          # tells USERNAME

uname -a         # tells architecture 32 bit or 64 bit

# echo variables
echo $USER
echo $HOME
echo $PATH
each $OLDPWD    # prints the old dir we were workning on before navigating to present dir
```

comment in ubuntu
---
```bash
# single line comments are preceeded by hashtag sign

some cmd    # a inline cmntt side by side to describe this cmd
```

**An option**, also referred to as a ***flag or a switch***, 

is a single-letter or full word that modifies the behavior of a command in some predetermined way.

e.g.
```bash
--help
--version

-a 
--all

-b
--bytes

-p
```


Statements
```bash
printf "hello world";
printf "hello world\n";
echo "hello world\n" 


rev             # reverses the string arg given to it
```

# Directory
***directory seprator*** is fwd slash **'`/`'**  

Colors  
- <span style="color:blue">blue</span> : directory


```bash



# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# rmdir : deletes only empty dir
rmdir dirName   # to  permanently  delete empty directory 
rmdir -p d1/d2/d3 # removes d3, the d2, then d1

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rm -i fileName      # to remove a file
rm -i *.cpp         # to remove all .cpp file

# switch -i make it interactive, asks YES/NO for each file 
# press Ctrl-C to stop the operation entirely.



rm -rf dirName   # to permanently delete a non-empty directory, üíÄ danger cmd, used only if u really want to delete that dir & no longer use in future. 
rm -r dirName   # r, means really, & recursively deletes all files/folders in the specified dir, üíÄ danger cmd
```

```bash
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ls 
ls -a           # shows hidden/dir files as well, switch -a means <all>
ls /mnt
ls /mnt/   # shows all drive in system
ls /SUB_DIR_NAME/SUB_SUB_DIR_NAME  # shows all file/folder in the specified subdir within a subdir
```

```bash
clear   # to clear console screen

pwd   # print working directory

cd         # change directory
cd /       # go to root dir
cd ~       # go to /home/USERNAME/ directory
cd ..      # come one dir backward 
cd ../..   # come two dir backward 
cd ../../FOLDER   # come two dir backward & then navigate to specified folder

cd -        # to switch to other working directory, on which we were earlier working

```

a good rule of thumb is to keep your file names all lower case, with only letters, numbers, '_' & '-'
```bash
touch fileName.ext         # to create a file in current working dir 
touch .fileName.ext         # to create a hidden file in current working dir 

mkdir newFolderName        # to make a new folder in the current dir
mkdir .newFolderName        # to make a new hidden folder in the current dir

mkdir                       # make directory

mkdir "folder name"       # if folder name consist of spaces

mkdir d1 d2 d3             # makes dir d1, d2, d3 in the currecnt dir}
# multiple arguments to mkdir to make multiple dir)

mkdir a/b/c                # makes dir  { [ (c inside b) inside a] inside current dir }, error comes if a & a/b dir  doesn't already exist
# hence use -p switch 
mkdir -p a/b/c             # makes dir  { [ (c inside b) inside a] inside current dir } 
# -p : an option or switch which means "create a parent dir too"
```
```bash
/ # often refers to as root directory
```
```bash
~ # is /home/USERNAME
```

File modify
===
See file contents 
---
```bash
# cat - concatenate

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# see the content of a file

cat op.txt                 # to see content of a file
cat f1.txt f2.txt f3.txt   # to see content of multiple files linked together in sequence

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# wildcard characters 


# * for 0 or more char
# ? for any single char

cat *.txt
cat o*            # print content of all files with filename starting from o
cat *             # print content of all files
```

Write into file 
---
```bash
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Write into file

echo "heya bor" > op.txt   # empty the op.txt & then write "heya bor" to txt file

echo "heya bor" >> op.txt   # append something to txt file


cat file.txt > op.txt
#  ``shell clears out all the content of the file before it writes the output of your cat command into it``

cat file.txt >> op.txt
# to ``append`` content of file.txt to op.txt



less things.txt         # to see content of file conveniently in "less" shell, use q to quit "less" & come back to cmd line, End(on key 1 at keyboard) to see End of file

wc -l <file>              # line count in the file
```

pipe char `|`, to provide output of one cmd as input to another cmd
```
sort b.txt | less
sort b.txt | uniq | less
ls / | less
ls d1/d2 | less
```


```bash
# extract a *.gz file
gunzip myfile.tar.gz   # will unzip it to myfile.tar
tar -xvf myfile.tar    # will untar it
```

File movement 
---
```bash
mv op.txt d1/d2 # move the op.txt to [ (d2 dir in d1 dir) in current dir ]

mv d1/* .   # move all file/folder in dir d1 to curent dir(denoted by .)

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``
# mv can take multiple arg as well

mv <pathToFile/FOLDER> <pathToFile/FOLDER> <pathToFile/FOLDER> <pathTOdestinationDIR>


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# rename using mv

mv oldName.txt newName.txt
mv oldDirName  newDirName # rename a subdir

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# copy

cp <pathOfFile> <pathWhereWeNeedToCopyFile>

cp file.txt BackupFile.txt
```

# c in linux
```bash
# first install g++ in linux using following cmd
sudo apt install g++    # to install g++

gcc -o code.exe code.c    # to compile code.c file 
./code.exe                # to run executable file(code.exe) of the code.cpp 

g++ -o code.exe code.cpp  # to compile code.cpp file 
./code.exe                # to run executable file(code.exe) of the code.cpp 



```

To create a new process, in UNIX, the `fork()` system call is use
```C++
#include<bits/stdc++.h>  
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <sys/wait.h> // for wait()
#include <unistd.h>   // for fork()
#include <stdlib.h>
using namespace std;

#define co cout<<
#define test() ll T; cin>>T; for(ll tc=0;tc<T;tc++)


/*
    getpid() : returns process id of a process

    wait()   : can be invoked by parent
               when it wants to wait for its child to finish termination,
               after which parent can continue its execution 

    exit()   : invoked when processs has finished execution
               it deallocates the resources(like I/O buffer, physical/virtual mem, open files) allocated to the process


    parent process - sorts the array in descending order
    chid   process - sorts the array in ascending  order



    Executing parent first 
    is not usually not a good idea since it may creates an orphan process

    When a process' parent dies before the child(withour waiting for the child to terminate),
    the OS assigns the child process to the "init" process or PID 1. i.e. 
    The init process "adopts" the child process and becomes its parent.

    This means that now when the child process exits 
    the new parent (init) must call wait() to get its exit code 
    or its process table entry remains forever and it becomes a zombie
*/

int main(){

    // #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    //     freopen("input.txt","r",stdin);
    //     freopen("output.txt","w",stdout);
    // #endif

    int data = 7;

    int pid = fork();

    // return code for fork() is -1 in case fork call fails
    if (pid < 0){
        cout << "cannot fork\n";
    }

    // return code for fork() is non-zero for parent process
    else if( pid > 0){

        cout << "\nPARENT PROCESS : " << getpid() <<endl;

        // some code
        // to manipulate int data;

        wait(NULL);
        exit(0);                // exit with status 0
    }

    // return code for fork() is zero for child process
    else if( pid == 0){

        sleep(20);     // process does some work that takes 20 seconds

        // some code 
        // to manipulate int data;

        exit(0);            // exit with status 0
    }

    return 0;
}

If you‚Äôre using Ubuntu the **root account is disabled by default**

On a Ubuntu system the first user created when the system is installed is considered to be the superuser

```bash
sudo # Switch User & DO

sudo apt update         # to update
sudo apt upgrade         # to update

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sudo apt install g++    # to install g++
sudo apt install tree   # now we can see our dir structure using "tree" cmd in our current dir
tree                     # shows all dir/subdir/file recursively
tree -a                  # displays hidden files/dir as well

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

sudo apt list --installed          # to see the package installed so far
sudo apt remove package_name        # to remove a package
```


USER MNGMT
---
```bash
sudo add <NEW_USERNAME>

# then it asks pswd of current user

# then it to set new pswd for new user a/c
# then it to confirm by retypin new pswd for new user a/c



sudo deluser  <NEW_USERNAME>
# Deleting an account does not remove their respective home folder. It is up to you whether or not you wish to delete the folder manually or keep it according to your desired retention policies.
```


How to Switch Users in Ubuntu and Other Linux Distributions
---
```bash
# to see current user
whoami

# to switch/login as another user
su another_user_name

# then prompt will come to enter pswed for another_user
# simply enter the paswd for that user
# then hit enter
# & you are in


exit 
# to exit current user session
